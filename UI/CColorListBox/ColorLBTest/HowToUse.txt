Follow these steps to add a CColorListBox to a dialog:

1. Add ColorListBox.cpp and ColorListBox.h to your project.
2. Add include "ColorListBox.h" to the header file of your dialog class.
3. Add a list box control to your dialog, with the Owner Draw style set to Fixed or Variable, and with the Has Strings style checked.
4. Use ClassWizard to add a member variable of type CColorListBox for the list box you just added. If CColorListBox is not in the Variable Type list, 
choose CListBox, and manually change the type to CColorListBox later.
